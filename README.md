# Backdoor
This is a rudimatary backdoor code in python, messy but working

Through the serveur you can directly speak with the victime terminal, whatever the os
use "dl" + "the file you want" to download the file("Make sure this is a file and not a directory or you will accounter an error")
use "cap" + "How you wana name it" to get a screen capture of the victime screen
use "infos" to know os and current directory 

I will soon implement folder dump fonction

Feel free to tell if something can be improved and maybe submit your own version
